# Plotly-challenge-2020-harless

This project was about gathering information from a json file that is stored locally on my computer to display two different graphs based on the userâ€™s selection from a dropdown menu.

The choices stored in the dropdown came from the json file of all id numbers in the file.
The Demographic box took in all key value pairs from the json file to give a summary for each id.

The horizontal bar graph and bubble chart were done using Plotly and gathering the parts of the json file necessary to build the graphs.
